# Mini-search-engine

Mini-search-engine is a C++ application to search through a collection of documents. Given a set of texts and a query, the search engine locates all documents that contain the keywords in the query.

The input data will be stored in "data" folder. Other "data" folders such as data1 and data2 are sample inputs. 

Mini-search-engine uses Trie to store and retrieve data.
