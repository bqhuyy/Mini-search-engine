Hey! Careful with those fireworks. They can hurt you, or even start a fire.

With July 4 right around the corner, that was the message from Los Angeles County firefighters Monday during a safety demonstration at the department’s Cecil R. Gehr Training Center in east Los Angeles.

That’s where several different agencies teamed up to issue their annual warning call, and to demonstrate just how dangerous fireworks can be, including those seemingly harmless sparklers.

It’s illegal to store, manufacture, sell, use, or handle all forms of fireworks without a valid permit in unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County.
