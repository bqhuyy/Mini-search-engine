While running for president, Trump called for a "total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States," though later in the campaign he revised that to say immigration should be suspended from any nation "compromised by terrorism." While his campaign audiences cheered for the idea, the initial executive order was followed by demonstrations by opponents in cities across the U.S. and abroad.

Some background on the two appeals court decisions that blocked the ban:

The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 10-3 on May 25 to uphold a nationwide halt to the policy, saying the travel ban was “steeped in animus and directed at a single religious group.” The majority pointed to Trump’s campaign vow to bar Muslims from entering the country and to the special preference for religious minorities included in an earlier version of the ban.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled June 12 that the president exceeded his authority with the sweeping travel restrictions without showing how letting those people in hurts American interests.
