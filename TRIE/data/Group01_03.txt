17 things every guy needs in his closet for summer
Summer is fast approaching. Before you set off for some fun in the sun, make sure you're prepared with the appropriate attire.

Since it's the hottest season of the year for most regions, dressing for summer is about more than just looking good. It's important to choose the right fabrics to feel good, too. 

Linen shirts, lightweight fabrics, and no-show socks are all things you can wear to avoid feeling too constricted. 

Here are the 17 clothing items every man needs for summer.

J Crew
When the sun starts to get serious, it's time to protect your eyes.

J.Crew came out with a line of sunglasses last year, and there's a look for everyone.

Chino shorts beat out cargo shorts any day of the week.

Ditch the cargo shorts — chino shorts just look so much better, and they have a much more flattering silhouette.

We recommend you grab a pair that hits above the knee (nine inches or shorter inseam) with a hint of stretch for additional comfort.

Uniqlo
For more casual times (think: Sunday brunch) don't reach for the jean shorts.

Instead, consider a pair of elastic shorts. They're not quite sweat shorts, but they're not quite chino shorts, either — they rest in the nebulous, comfortable in-between area. 

Thery're also extremely comfortable — perfect for lazing around on the weekend.

Club Monaco
Swim trunks are often overlooked until the moment you need them.

Don't let that happen again this year, and buy a stylish pair of trunks way before you're headed to the beach. Stripes and color blocking can add interest, but the real thing to watch out for is length.

Long swim trunks always look awkward. Aim for ones that hit about mid-thigh.

Loath as we are to admit it, there are times when you're going to need to wear long pants.

Lightweight chinos will make those times all the more bearable.

It's true that Hawaiian-style shirts have been popular for a while now. They're cool, fun, and undeniably perfect for summer.

Hop on the bandwagon with a safe take on the trend, like this one from Old Navy that has a bold print on a muted background. Since it's just a fun tongue-in-cheek item, you can go cheap here.

Loafer socks can get you the sockless look without the stink.

Hugo Boss
Summer is a time for going sockless. The problem: Feet stink.

Avoid that altogether by wearing truly no-show socks called loafer socks, which will provide comfort and absorb sweat without showing above your low-cut loafer. My favorites are from Taft, which include rubber on the heel so that the small amount of heel fabric doesn't slip off while you wear them.

A fun T-shirt for when it's just too hot for anything else.

Uniqlo
You know those hot summer days: As soon as you leave the house, you instantly become a sweaty mess.

But plain T-shirts can get boring after a while, so try mixing it up with a fun pattern. Stripes are a classic summer look, and they have a great history in menswear.

Uniqlo ($15)
A polo shirt to keep it casual.

Mr Porter
If you don't have a nice polo shirt to pull out of your closet in case of a heat emergency, it's time to invest in one.

This Theory version isn't cheap, but you can't beat its casual-cool look. There are endless options — find one that speaks to you.

A high-quality linen shirt is a godsend in hot weather.

Though linen has a reputation for being scratchy and uncomfortable, it's worth it to have something lightweight in hot weather.

A high-quality linen blend, like this one from Uniqlo, is the best of both worlds. It's not scratchy, and it's extremely light but durable. As a bonus, it's work-appropriate.

Leather is so heavy and sweaty in the summer. Look summer-ready with a NATO watch strap, which will instantly give your whole outfit a more casual, laid-back vibe.

They're available in virtually every color and pattern under the sun, so they can go with whatever summer wardrobe you're working with.

Leather is for winter — cotton is for summer.

Dress down with a cotton belt, which elicits the carefree, seafaring attitude of summer havens like Martha's Vineyard or Nantucket.

While some prefer the ease of flip-flops, we prefer the structure of sandals when we head to the beach.

You can't get much better than Birkenstocks, which have been worn by generations and have earned a reputation for quality.

Rancourt & Co
It's no secret that white shoes are the new thing to wear when the weather gets a little nicer.

That means you should get a pair. The basketball-inspired new white shoe by Maine-based moccasin manufacturer Rancourt hits the perfect sweet spot between price, quality, and style.

LL Bean
Ditch your sweaty boat shoes for the more refined look of a blucher moccasin.

It's not a far cry from its seafaring cousin, but it's definitely an upgrade. L.L. Bean has a great pair in its signature line.

J. Crew
Whether it's for a wedding or an office day job, sometimes you just need to wear a suit in the summer. Don't reach for that heavy woolen thing when you can get one in a summer-friendly fabric like linen.

As a bonus, the jacket from a suit like this would make a great blazer when the time calls for that.

Our favorite is from Everlane — it's the perfect size, with a great strap that can go either over the shoulder or in your hands.

It's not too expensive, either. You'll likely get years of use out of it.
