LOS ANGELES — A red flag warning signifying a high risk of wildfire because of high winds, high temperatures, low humidity and dry vegetation will be in effect today in parts of Los Angeles County as the region’s heat wave drags on for one more day before coming to a close after exactly two weeks.

The red flag warning issued by the National Weather Service will be in force in the San Gabriel Mountains and the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys for 12 hours beginning at 9 a.m. as some Southland temperatures again climb into the 100s -- in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys.

“A hot and dry air mass will combine with gusty onshore winds on Monday and Monday evening to produce critical fire weather conditions across the Santa Clarita and Antelope valley as well as the Los Angeles County mountains,” according to a statement.

Southwest winds of 15 to 25 miles per hour gusting to 35 mph will blow through the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Clarita Valley this morning while winds of 20-30 mph with 45-mph gusts are forecast for the Antelope Valley, NWS forecaster said.

Humidity levels are forecast to be between 6 and 13 percent in the San Gabriels and the Santa Clarita Valley and between 3 and 10 percent in the Antelope Valley this morning, remaining “below critical humidity” through tonight, according to an NWS statement.

“If fire ignition occurs, conditions are favorable for extreme fire behavior, which would threaten life and property,” it said.

Several heat records for a June 25 were set Sunday, the NWS said this morning. A record high of 111 was set at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, breaking the record of 104 set in 1990; In Woodland Hills, Sunday’s high of 111 beat the record 108 set in 1970; in Lancaster, the mercury hit 108, 2 degrees higher than the 106 recorded in 2006; and at Sandberg in the San Gabriels, the 97 hit Sunday beat the 95 set last year.

The weather service forecast sunny skies in L.A. County today and highs of 76 in Torrance; 77 at LAX; 78 in Big Bear; 79 in San Pedro; 87 in Avalon; 88 in Long Beach and downtown L.A.; 91 on Mount Wilson; 94 in Whittier; 95 in San Gabriel; 96 in West Covina, Pasadena and Burbank; 97 in North Hollywood; 99 in Van Nuys and Rancho Cucamonga; 101 in Ontario; 102 in Santa Clarita; 103 in Northridge, Palmdale, Lancaster and Redlands; 105 in Woodland Hills; and 107 in San Bernardino.

Sunny skies were also forecast in Orange County, along with highs of 71 in San Clemente; 73 in Laguna Beach; 75 in Newport Beach; 92 in Irvine and Anaheim; 95 in Fullerton; 96 in Mission Viejo; and 97 in Yorba Linda.


Temperatures will fall sharply Tuesday, shedding up to 13 degrees in parts of the San Fernando Valley, then remain mostly in the 70s and low 80s at least through the next six days, according to the NWF. Orange County temperatures will fall by up to 14 degrees Tuesday and a few more degrees Wednesday, then remain in the high 70s or low 80s for several days.

Tuesday should be regarded as the end of the heat wave that began June 6, said NWS meteorologist Kurt Caplan.
